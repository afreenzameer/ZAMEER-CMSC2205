# ZAMEER-CMSC2205
Lab Two Retrospective:
Time to complete: two weeks. This lab was extremely difficult for me, I had a lot of trouble with the remove method in particular. After it was explained to me in class it was a little easier, but I still needed help with the actual code which I got from the class recording. I had more trouble with the tests than the actual methods as it was a new way of testing for me, but the code we did in class really helped. Overall this lab was very hard but I do feel like I understand nodes better.
