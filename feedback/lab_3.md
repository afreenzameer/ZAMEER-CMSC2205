## Lab 3 Feedback

Everything here is looking good! One thing that is interesting but not a problem is that you used < Dog > in your test class.

This makes the test class itself generic, which is unneeded. In addition, you porbably don't want to use a word like "Dog" like that, as it would seem to imply that the class uses a Dog class, when really it uses anything, but anything is labelled a "Dog"

Let me know if you have any questions about any of that.

Bonus: 1 point
